## <a name="physical">1. Physical Layer: Hardware & Infrastructure</a>

* Provides a surface for AI models to run and process data, relying upon Tensor Processing Units (TPUs) and GPUs (e.g., AMD, NVIDIA).
  + Google is known for designing TPUs, with various partners assisting with the manufacturing of these units.
* This layer is responsible for high speed data processing, storage, and distributing AI data processing workloads.
* **Notable Uses:** On-premise AI servers, and popular cloud-based platforms (e.g., Amazon's AWS, Google Cloud, Microsoft Azure)
